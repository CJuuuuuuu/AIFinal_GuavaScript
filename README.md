# Project Title

GuavaScript, a Guava Quality Predictor

## Project Description

GuavaScript is an AI project that aims to predict the quality of guavas based on their photos and traceable information. The project utilizes deep learning techniques, including the Un2net and VGG16 models, to preprocess images and extract features. It also incorporates a random forest regressor model to predict the taste attributes of guavas. By providing accurate information about guava quality, the project addresses the challenges of guava selection, reduces wastage of unsalable fruit, and contributes to the reduction of food waste in Taiwan. Additionally, it aims to mitigate the impact of China's boycott on Taiwanese fruits by increasing domestic sales.

## Getting Started

To get started with GuavaScript, you need to have the following software and data:

Python and its required libraries (including TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, and pandas)
The dataset containing guava photos and corresponding attributes (e.g., sweetness, sourness, crunchiness, hardness, and flavor)
Pretrained models (Un2net, VGG16, and the random forest regressor model) or train them using the provided code
